* OrioleDB beta has been released
  Long story short, OrioleDB alpha version was released more than year ago. More than 200 bugs were fixed since then. Now, OrioleDB reached beta stage. That means we recommend OrioleDB for pre-production testing. The most interesting workloads for testing could include: high transaction troughput, high volume of updates, high volume of in-memory operations, lock bottlenecks and other extreme cases.
